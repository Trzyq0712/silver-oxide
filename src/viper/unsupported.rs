//! Naming the Viper constructs this verifier does not implement.
//!
//! Everything that reaches here is *parseable*: the grammar accepts the whole
//! surface syntax it can recognise, and turns the parts we do not implement
//! into `ExpKind::Unsupported` / `Statement::Unsupported` markers or into
//! ordinary nodes we then refuse here (a magic wand, `epsilon`, a `Seq` type).
//! One scan per declaration is what lets the pipeline report "this declaration
//! uses `package`" and carry on with the rest of the file, instead of dying at
//! the first construct with a parse error that names something else.
//!
//! The rule this module encodes: **if we cannot give a construct its Viper
//! meaning, the declaration that mentions it does not verify.** Constructs we
//! merely lower differently (`decreases`, dropped, with termination checked
//! nowhere) belong in the documentation, not here — a scan hit means the
//! declaration is rejected.
