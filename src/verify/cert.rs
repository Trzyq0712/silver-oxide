//! Verified-body **definitions**: a function's or resource's body captured once
//! as an add-only **term recipe** and rebuilt at each call site with
//! [`build_instance`](crate::verify::rewrite::build_instance) (formal params →
//! actual args). Unlike the earlier e-graph certificates these import **no
//! e-classes**, so a merge proven during the body's own verification (e.g. a
//! precondition equality) never rides along into a caller — the caller re-derives
//! whatever it needs itself. See the plan's Findings B/C.
